# Encrypted Video Player for Android

This Android application allows users to play encrypted video files with high security and performance. The encrypted video files use the `.mp4` extension, and to decrypt and play them, a unique key file must be generated using the **Key Generate App**.

## Features

- **High Security**: Video files are encrypted to ensure only authorized users can access and play the content.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for smooth video playback, even with large encrypted files.
- **Easy to Use**: Generate a key file using the "Key Generate App" and play the encrypted MP4 video files effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before using the player, you must have the following:

1. **Encrypted MP4 Video File**: A video file that has been encrypted using this project.
2. **Key File**: A file generated using the **Key Generate App** that is required to decrypt and play the video.

## Installation

1. **Download the APK**: Download the **Encrypted Video Player** APK and install it on your Android device.
2. **Install the Key Generate App**: Download and install the **Key Generate App** to generate the necessary key file for your encrypted video.

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate the Key File

1. Open the **Key Generate App** on your Android device.
2. Select the encrypted video file (with `.mp4` extension) that you want to play.
3. Click on **Generate Key** to create the corresponding key file for the encrypted video.
4. Save the key file to a location on your device that is easily accessible.

### Step 2: Play the Encrypted Video

1. Launch the **Encrypted Video Player** app on your Android device.
2. Tap on **Select Encrypted Video** and navigate to the encrypted `.mp4` video file you wish to play.
3. When prompted, select the generated key file that corresponds to the encrypted video.
4. Tap on **Play** to begin watching the video.

The video will decrypt in real-time and will be played securely and efficiently.

## Security

The encryption and decryption process uses strong encryption standards to protect the content. Ensure that the key file is stored in a secure location, as it is the only way to decrypt and view the encrypted video files.

- The **Key Generate App** should be used only on trusted Android devices.
- Keep your key file private and avoid sharing it unless absolutely necessary.
- The encrypted video file can only be decrypted using the corresponding key file. Without the key, the video cannot be accessed.

## Performance

This app is optimized for fast encryption/decryption and smooth video playback. The decryption happens on the fly during playback, so users wonâ€™t experience noticeable delays.

The player is designed to handle large encrypted video files without compromising performance, providing a smooth viewing experience.
